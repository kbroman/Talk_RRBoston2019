  \note{These are slides for a talk I'm going to give at a
    reproducible research workshop at Boston University on 14 May
    2019.

    By ``reproducibly,'' I'm referring to ``computational
    reproducibility,'' by which I mean that the data and code for a
    project are packaged together in a way that they can be handed to
    someone else, who can rerun the code and get the same
    results---the same figures and tables. This is surprisingly hard
    to do, and it's even more difficult in the context of a
    collaboration between two or more data analysts.

 Karl -- this is very interesting,
 however you used an old version of
 the data (n=143 rather than n=226).

 I'm really sorry you did all that
 work on the incomplete dataset.

\note{I'm an applied statistician; my goal is to help people make
  sense of their data. I have a lot of collaborators, and there's
  nothing I enjoy more than puzzling over their data. So I write a lot of
  reports, describing what I've done and what I've learned.

  This is an email I got from a collaborator,
  in response to an analysis report that I had sent him.
  It's always a bit of a shock to get an email like this: what have I
  done? Why am I working with the wrong data, and where is the right data?

  But what he didn't know is that by this point in my life, I'd
  adopted a reproducible workflow.
  Because I'd set things up carefully, I could just substitute in the
  newer dataset, type a single command (``{\tt make}'') to rerun the
  analyses, and get the revised report.

  This is a reproducibility success story. We all make mistakes, but
  if our projects are reproducible, we can nimbly recover from those
  mistakes.

  There is a second important lesson here: At the start of such
  reports, I always include a paragraph about our shared goals, along
  with some brief data summaries. By doing so, he immediately saw that
  I had an old version of the data. If I hadn't done so, we might
  never have discovered my error.

Reproducible

{\color{lolit} vs.}

\only<1>{Replicable}
\only<2 | handout 0>{Correct}

\note{Computational work is
  {\color{nhilit} reproducible} if the data and code are organized in
  a way that they can be handed to someone else, who can rerun the
  code and get the same results---the same figures and tables.
  {\color{nhilit} Replicable} is more stringent: can
  someone repeat the experiment and get the same results?

  Reproducibility is a minimal standard. That something is
  reproducible doesn't imply that it is correct. The code may have bugs. The
  methods may be poorly behaved. There could be experimental
  artifacts.

  (But reproducibility is probably associated with correctness.)

  Note that some scientists say replicable for what I call
  reproducible, and vice versa.

\note{It was a long, hard process for me to move from my old standard
  practice to a fully reproducible workflow. In thinking through that
  process, I wrote down my thoughts on the basic steps to take towards
  full reproducibility. This was aimed really at programmers, but it
  forms the basis of what I'll present here.

  But don't try to change every aspect of your workflow all at once.

  are to put everything related to a project in a common directory,

  processed data.

  Write {\tt ReadMe} files to explain what's what. Make sure they stay

  \note{
    Collaboration has a lot of advantages, including for
    reproducibility efforts.

    It can be useful to have a pair of people regularly review each
    other's code, but it can be hard to get your busy friends to pay
    attention to your little project. But if you are working together
    on a project, you can more naturally build in some code review.

    Moreover, you can explicitly test the reproducibility of your
    analyses, by having your collaborator rerun your work, and vice
    versa.

  \note{
    Collaboration also has challenges.

    Do you have a shared vision for the reproducibility of the
    project? You'll no doubt need to make some compromises about how
    things are done: you can't both just do things the way you've
    always done them. Careful coordination and regular communication
    are key.

    And then there are the technical challenges of how to share the
    code and data and make sure your two working projects remain in
    sync.

    In a sense, the reproducibility of a collaborative project is
    dependent on the weakest link. If one collaborator refuses to
    fully participate and share their work, the chain is broken.

  Say the first of many sets of data are set up in a way that is
  complicated to handle, both in data entry and for analysis. Will
  your collaborator work with you to refine things?

  Or will every new data file require a day of work, so that it can be
  combined with prior data?

  analysis teams, so that relevant analyses get rerun as needed?

\note{
  Everyone has multiple things going on, and sometimes there is need
  for rush analyses, say for a grant submission or conference
  presentation. Is there a shared understanding of who will do what
  when, and how emergencies can be handled?

  The organization of a project often depends on the worst day you
  spent on it. If you need to do a bunch of stuff last-minute, will
  you leave the project directory in a mess, or will you clean up
  after yourself?

\note{
  Critical for a successful collaboration is that the collaborators
  have a shared vision for the project. We often maybe think about
  being in agreement on the approach to publication and co-authorship.
  But perhaps more difficult is coming to an agreement on data and
  code sharing (what, where, and when?), on who will do what, on how
  soon it will be done, and on the ongoing sharing, among collaborators,
  of detailed methods and results.

\note{
    Also important is the technology or engineering of sharing. Can
    the collaborators agree on the project structure, data and
    metadata formats, and the software environment?

    Some groups may use R and some python. This should not pose a problem.

    A key issue is how to keep the multiple groups' work in sync. It
    is best that this can be done automatically. Experience
    demonstrates that if synchronization approach requires some manual
    steps, they will not be done consistently.

\note{
  I must admit to not being totally confident about what advice to
  give, regarding the tools to use for sharing data and code among
  collaborators.

  For sharing data, simple options include posting large files on a
  data repository like figshare, or using cloud drive like dropbox,
  box, or google drive.

  For sharing code, I prefer to use a version control system like git,
  with github, bitbucket, or a locally-managed equivalent.

  For sharing the analysis pipeline or workflow, one can
  incorporate a system like make (or drake, snakemake, or rake) with
  the code.

  The full software environment could be replicated across teams using
  docker containers. Binder and Whole Tale are two systems for making
  this easier.

\note{
  I've long felt that the key need, in getting computational

  most part, all of the software tools are available, but many people
  haven't incorporated them into their daily work.
